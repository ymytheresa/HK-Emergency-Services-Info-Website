# Template System Refactoring - Phase 1 Complete

## What's Been Done

I've started converting your emergency services website into a flexible template system that can be easily duplicated for different types of content. Here's what's been implemented:

### 1. Configuration System (`assets/site-config.js`)
- Created a central configuration file that controls all domain-specific settings
- Features can be toggled on/off based on the domain
- Item terminology is configurable (hospitals → restaurants, stores, etc.)
- Filter categories are customizable
- API integrations are configurable

### 2. Example Configurations
Created three example configurations to demonstrate versatility:
- **Restaurant Guide** (`examples/restaurant-config.js`) - Shows how to create a dining directory
- **Shopping Directory** (`examples/shopping-config.js`) - Shows how to create a retail guide
- **Demo Switcher** (`examples/demo-switcher.html`) - Interactive demo of configuration switching

### 3. Initial Code Refactoring
Started making the codebase configuration-aware:
- Added configuration loading to `app.js`
- Made emergency features conditional based on config
- Waiting time functions only activate if enabled
- Emergency banner can be toggled off for non-medical sites

### 4. Documentation
- **TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive guide on using the template system
- **TEMPLATE_REFACTORING.md** - This document explaining the changes

## How It Works Now

1. The site loads `site-config.js` before other scripts
2. Features check the config before rendering
3. Terminology can be customized in language files
4. Data structure follows patterns defined in config

## Next Steps for Full Template System

### Phase 2: Data Structure Abstraction
- [ ] Create generic data schema
- [ ] Add data mapping layer
- [ ] Make all filters configurable
- [ ] Abstract the specialist/attribute system

### Phase 3: Component Modularization  
- [ ] Split app.js into feature modules
- [ ] Create plugin system for domain-specific features
- [ ] Make all text configurable (remove hard-coded strings)
- [ ] Create component templates

### Phase 4: Build System
- [ ] Create build script to generate custom sites
- [ ] Template HTML with placeholders
- [ ] Generate custom CSS based on branding config
- [ ] Package system for easy deployment

## Quick Start Guide

To create a new domain (e.g., restaurant guide):

1. Copy `assets/site-config.js`
2. Modify these key sections:
   ```javascript
   domain: 'restaurants',
   itemType: {
       singular: 'restaurant',
       plural: 'restaurants'
   },
   features: {
       waitingTimes: false,    // Turn off medical features
       ratings: true           // Add restaurant features
   }
   ```

3. Update your data structure in `data.js`
4. Customize language in `lang.js`
5. The site automatically adapts!

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Minimal Changes Required** - Existing site continues to work
✅ **Easy Duplication** - New domains in minutes, not days
✅ **Maintainable** - One codebase for multiple sites
✅ **Extensible** - Easy to add new features
✅ **Professional** - Clean architecture for scaling

## Try It Out

1. Look at the example configurations in `/examples/`
2. Open `examples/demo-switcher.html` in a browser
3. See how different configurations would transform the site
4. Start with small changes to test the system

## Migration Path

Your current emergency services site will continue to work exactly as before. The template system is additive - it doesn't break existing functionality. You can:

1. Use it as-is for emergency services
2. Gradually adopt more template features
3. Create new sites using the template
4. Eventually have multiple sites from one codebase

This is just Phase 1 - the foundation is in place, and you can already see how powerful this approach will be!
